### Problem:
Deterministic life-cycle investing is a simple strategy popular with defined-contribution pension providers. However, this traditional method is sometimes sub-optimal because it fails to adequately account for individuals’ investment horizon, spanning their entire life, and also does not differentiate among investors with different characteristics.

### Solution：
Dynamic and customized GBI method

### Implementation
1) Identify a client’s financial goals in terms of the four goal attributes: Term, Amount, Tolerance for Shortfall Risk and Priority.
2) Create a menu of candidate funds (model allocation). For each fund, provide the expected return and volatility, and specifies how the fund’s assets are mapped to broad asset classes (e.g. equities, fixed income or cash). 
3) For each acceptable shortfall risk level, compute optimal model allocation for each goal with the minimum required investment
